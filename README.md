Ink is a commerce website used to sell books. In regards to the books, the website provides the book's information, the book's author, and information about the author. Books will be added to inventory using Shopify's API, which allows customers to select books, add them to their cart, and create an account to simplify the process of making purchases. Shopify Will also allow the owner to update inventory, provide and update shipping information, and grow their website.

In order to simplify the process of adding the top menu shown on every page, the HTML code for the top menu was typed into a Javascript file and linked in the header of each page. The file "topmenu.js" holds the HTML code for the menu.

<br>
"jscript.js" is the file used to help create the slider that displays the collection of books.
